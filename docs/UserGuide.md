# MatchMate User Guide

MatchMate is a **desktop app for Computer Science students in NUS to create groups among their friends / acquaintances,
as well as to allow students to find balanced groups with diverse skill sets out of their own contact list.** 
It is optimized for Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

This User Guide assumes that you have zero knowledge of our app and does not require any programming knowledge. However,
familiarity with keyboard shortcuts will significantly improve your experience with Matchmate.

</div>

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
   <box type="info" seamless>

   First check if you have Java 11 by opening your terminal, and typing in `java -version`. If the command fails, that means that
   you have not downloaded Java yet. If you do not have Java 11 installed yet, then you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/).
   
   </box>

1. Download the latest `matchmate.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/releases/latest).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your app.

1. Select "Open in Terminal" in the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar matchmate.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try, these commands simulate the user flow of adding contacts, creating a group that require skills, and finding members for said group:

   * `list` : Lists all courseMates.
   
   * `add John Doe -p 87654321 -e johndoe@example.com -s Leadership -s C++`: Adds a courseMate named `John Doe` to the courseMate list.

   * `delete #3` : Deletes the 3rd courseMate shown in the current list.
   
   * `create-group CS Group -cm John Doe -s C++ -s Java` : Creates a group containing John Doe, this group also requires the skill C++.
   
   * `suggest-mate CS Group`: Suggests a possible courseMate whose skills match some unfulfilled skills in the group `CS Group`.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#navigating-the-user-guide) above for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## User Interface

The UI consists of four main components:

![Ui Components](images/ui-structure.png)

1. **Command Box**: You can type your commands here and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute them. You can also use the <kbd>:fas-caret-up:</kbd> and <kbd>:fas-caret-down:</kbd> arrow keys to navigate through your command history.
    <box type="info" seamless>

    **Note:** The <kbd>:fas-caret-up:</kbd> key will retrieve the previous command in the command history. When there is no previous command, it will cycle back to the most recent command. The <kbd>:fas-caret-down:</kbd> key will retrieve the next command. However, it will not cycle if you have reached the most recent command.

    This behavior is similar to the command history in a typical terminal.

    </box>
2. **CourseMate List Panel**: Displays the list of courseMates. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or double click to select a courseMate from the courseMate list panel.
3. **CourseMate Detail Panel**: Displays the details of a selected courseMate.
4. **Group List Panel**: Displays the list of groups.

You can use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to switch between the command box and the courseMate list panel.

<box type="tip" seamless>

<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Example</span> If you want to add a few selected courseMates to a group, you can:
1. Select the first courseMate in the courseMate list panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The courseMate will be displayed in the courseMate detail panel.
2. Type `add-member GROUP_NAME -cm ##` in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
3. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch to the courseMate list panel. Select the next courseMate and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
4. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch back to the command box and press <kbd>:fas-caret-up:</kbd> to retrieve the previous command. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute the command.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the remaining courseMates.

This way, you can quickly add multiple courseMates to a group without having to type the courseMate names each time.

</box>

## Commands: General

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `add NAME [-p PHONE_NUMBER]` can be used as `add John Doe -p 8762318` or as `add John Doe`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[-s SKILL]...​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `-s C++`, `-s C++ -s Python` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

Consider adding a suffix to the name to differentiate them.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A courseMate can have any number of skills (including 0). Skill names are also case-insensitive.
</box>

Examples:

- `add John Doe -e e1234567@u.nus.edu`

   The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
2. This is followed by a `@` and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
   The domain name must:
    - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long;

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### Editing a courseMate : `edit`

Edits an existing courseMate with a given name. This command supports changing the name, email, phone number and telegram handle.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:**

Instead of supplying a full name to identify an existing courseMate, you can use the following shortcuts:
- `#1`, `#2`, ..., `#n` (where n is the number of courseMates currently displayed in the courseMate list panel) – `#k` references the k-th courseMate currently displayed in the courseMate list panel.


- `##` – References the courseMate currently displayed in the detailed view panel.


- A substring of the name instead of the full name.
    - In the event of multiple matches (the substring appears in multiple courseMates), you will receive the following message: `There are ? course mates with name containing ???. You can retry by giving the course mate's complete name or use the index of the contact.` and the list of matching courseMates will be displayed in the courseMate list panel.
    - No side effects will be made by the current command.
    - You should retry the command by finding the courseMate on the list and using the hashtag notation (`#`) to identify the courseMate.
  <br><br>

  <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Example</span>
    - You have the following courseMates listed in the courseMate list panel:  
      `#1 Benson`  
      `#2 Ben`  
      Typing `edit Ben` will display a warning message for having multiple matches.
    - Case 1: If you want to edit Benson:
        - Type  `edit Benson ...` or just its substring `edit Bens ...`.
        - Alternatively, you can use the alias `edit #1 ...`.
    - Case 2: If you want to edit Ben:
        - Type `edit #2 ...` as you must specify its index in the list.
</box>

Examples:
- `edit John Doe -n Joe Schmo`
- `edit #1 -n Joe Schmo`
- `edit John -e johndoe@gmail.com -p 98765432`

## Other Features

### Save and load the state of app

Load the saved data when starting the app. Save the state of courseMates and groups every time it is updated via adding or editing. This should run automatically on start and subsequently after a command that alters the state of the app (e.g. add, edit).

### Editing the data file

MatchMate data are saved automatically as JSON files in `[JAR file location]/data/`. It is possible but not recommended to edit the different `.json` files directly instead of through the app.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
It is recommended to take a backup of the original save file before editing it.<br>
Certain edits can cause the MatchMate to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Troubleshooting

**Q**: I encountered the error message `Invalid command format!` when I tried to execute a command. What should I do?<br>
**A**: You are likely to have missed out on a required parameter for the command. Refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) for the correct format of the command.
Note that parameters in square brackets are optional, while those without square brackets are required.

**Q**: I encountered the error message `Some of the specified members could not be found.` when I tried to add a member to a group. What should I do?<br>
**A**: If you used the hashtag notation (`##` or `#n`) to refer to a courseMate, check if the courseMate is displayed in the panel. Retry the command with an existing hashtag. Otherwise, you may have misspelled the courseMate's name. You can use the `find-mate` command to search for the courseMate.

**Q**: I accidentally deleted a courseMate. Can I undo the deletion?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, the deletion of a courseMate is irreversible. You will need to re-add the courseMate to the list.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MatchMate home folder.

**Q**: Do I need internet connection to run MatchMate?<br>
**A**: MatchMate is an offline application that does not require any internet connection.

**Q**: How do I save the changes that I have made?<br>
**A**: All your data is automatically saved, so there's no need to manually save it.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
